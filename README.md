# Ice Cream App 🍦

This is my first project on with Ionic. The project is a mobile application developed with **Ionic & Angular** as part of a comparative study of mobile technologies.

## Description
The application allows a server to create an ice cream by selecting:
- ice cream flavours (up to 5 scoops),
- a container (cone or cup),
- optional extras (whipped cream, hazelnuts).

The app manages stock levels, displays out-of-stock alerts, and simulates ordering missing items by email.

## Features
- Flavour selection with quantity control
- Maximum scoop validation
- Container and extras selection
- Price calculation
- Stock management
- Out-of-stock alert and ordering
- Multi-page navigation

## Technologies
- Ionic
- Angular
- TypeScript
- HTML / SCSS

## Installation

npm install
ionic serve
